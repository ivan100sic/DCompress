# DCompress
Algorithm which compresses a fairly large set of words

See https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for copyright info regarding "words.txt"
Most other .txt files shall be derived from this one.

For simplicity, all compression algorithms output a file consisting of a series of digits 0 and 1.
The actual size of a compressed file would be approx. 8 times smaller.
